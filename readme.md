# Red Team Personas CF25

request to be added as a collaborator, or fork the repo and open a pull request to contribute to main

- mock personas are populated by day

## Assumptions

- still figuring out how to connect client to server (assmuing JV will take care of this if he is manually configuring virtual machines)
    - JV, you should hopefully be able to download each persona (json) file and upload to respective client

## Questions

- do we need to make timelines for each persona?
- how do we connect a data source (client) to grafana (frontend server)?
    - the example (admin sequence from documentation) uses a postgresql data source, is it the same backend on our virtual machine regardless of operating system?
- we winged the file structure, where do we assign the specific "Role" (from Enrichment_Reqs.xlsx)?
- which enclave in red team infrastructure has all the red team personas?
