# Red Team Personas CF25

- mock personas are populated by day

- still figuring out how to connect client to server (assmuing JV will take care of this if he is configuring virtual machines on AWS)
- - JV, you should hopefully be able to download each persona (json) file and upload to respective client

## Questions

- do we need to make timelines for each persona?
- how do we connect the data source (client) to grafana (frontend server)?
